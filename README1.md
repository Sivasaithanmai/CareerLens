Credit Card Fraud Detection

Hey there! This project is all about detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python. The goal is to explore data, understand patterns, and build models that can predict fraud with high accuracy.

Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major issue worldwide, and early detection can save both businesses and customers a lot of money. This project demonstrates:

Data exploration and visualization

Feature analysis

Handling imbalanced datasets

Building machine learning models for fraud detection
